#MovieDB_ObjC

A sample iOS project in objective-C. This project is about Movies and TvShows. It gives some info about movies and TvShows based on different criteria (popular, top rated, etc). It uses [themoviedb database](themoviedb.org).
There is no test integration for now.

> This project illustrates some very basic features in objective-c and how I code.
